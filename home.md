Welcome to your new Wiki!

You've successfully started the software and entered the frontend. Now you can edit everything! Maybe start with this page: It is the start page which will be visited automatically on visiting the Wiki without an direct link to any sub-page. The content you're seeing right now is not stored but only served when there is no stored [[Home]] page.

When editing you can use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to style your contents. If you are familiar with it you should find everything as you are used to with one exception: Inside this Wiki you can link any [[Page]] using double brackets. Those will automatically get rewritten into internal links which have slightly different loading behaviour than external links. But even creating those will work just fine.

In case you experience trouble, have feature requests or feedback just visit the [Issue-Tracker](https://github.com/Luzifer/wiki/issues) on Github or take a look at the [Code](https://github.com/Luzifer/wiki).
